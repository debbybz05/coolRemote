This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Folder Structure

After creation, your project should look like this:

```
my-app/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/
    index.html
    favicon.ico
  src/
    App.css
    App.js
    App.test.js
    index.css
    index.js
    logo.svg
```

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

* `public/index.html` is the page template;
* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.

Run:
npm install
npm start 

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
